              Christopher and his wife, Jenna, have always called the San
              Gabriel Valley home. Growing up in a Christian household with five
              siblings, Christopher’s faith journey truly deepened in college
              where he felt he began to follow Jesus as a disciple. It was on
              his college debate team, running a “Jesus ethics” argument, that
              he first discovered his passion for sharing the transformative way
              of Jesus with others. Christopher and his wife, Jenna, have always

              deep discernment and prayer, and with the blessing of his former
              church, Christopher and his family embarked on a new
              chapter—planting a church in partnership with the Free Methodist
              Church. Christopher and Jenna live in Alhambra with their three
              children, excited for the next steps in their faith journey
              together.
