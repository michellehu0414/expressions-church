            </header>
            <p>Christopher and his wife, Jenna, have always called the San Gabriel Valley home.
                Growing
                up in a Christian household with five siblings, Christopher’s faith journey truly
                deepened in college where he felt he began to follow Jesus as a disciple. It was on
                his
                college debate team, running a “Jesus ethics” argument, that he first discovered his
                passion for sharing the transformative way of Jesus with others.

                Following a season of deep discernment and prayer, and with the blessing of his
                former
                church, Christopher and his family embarked on a new chapter—planting a church in
                partnership with the Free Methodist Church. Christopher and Jenna live in Alhambra
                with
                their three children, excited for the next steps in their faith journey together.
