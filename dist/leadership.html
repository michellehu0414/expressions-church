Growing up in a Christian household with five siblings, Christopher’s faith journey truly deepened in college where he felt he began to follow Jesus as a disciple.

Christopher and his wife, Jenna, have always called the San Gabriel Valley home. Growing up in a Christian household with five siblings, Christopher’s faith journey truly deepened in college where he felt he began to follow Jesus as a disciple. It was on his college debate team, running a “Jesus ethics” argument, that he first discovered his passion for sharing the transformative way of Jesus with others. Following a season of deep discernment and prayer, and with the blessing of his former church, Christopher and his family embarked on a new chapter—planting a church in partnership with the Free Methodist Church. Christopher and Jenna live in Alhambra with their three children, excited for the next steps in their faith journey together.</p></div></section><img class="white-chalk-divider" src="https://vrwpaviv.elementor.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/white-chalk-divider.webp" alt=""><section id="staff" class="sectionWrapper"><header class="section-header"><h2>Staff</h2><img class="img-chalk-heading-underline" src="https://vrwpaviv.elementor.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chalk-underline_scribble-01_teal.webp" alt=""></header><div class="content-wrapper"><div id="staff-01" class="bio"><div class="bio-portrait-wrapper"><img src="https://vrwpaviv.elementor.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/polaroid_christopher.webp" alt=""></div><div class="text-wrapper"><header class="bio-header"><h3>Spongebob Squarepants</h3></header><p>SpongeBob SquarePants is a cheerful and optimistic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea in Bikini Bottom.
